Plagium is a paid plagiarism detection software that is designed to help individuals and organizations detect instances of plagiarism in written content. It uses advanced algorithms and technologies to compare submitted content against a vast database of sources, including academic journals, websites, and other online sources.

Users of Plagium can upload documents or enter text directly into the software's interface to check for potential instances of plagiarism. The software then scans the content and provides a detailed report highlighting any passages or phrases that match with content from other sources.

One of the unique features of Plagium is its ability to detect "mashups" of content, where text is taken from multiple sources and combined to create a new piece of content. This can be especially useful in detecting instances of plagiarism in online content, where individuals may copy and paste content from multiple sources to create a new article or post.

Plagium is a paid service, and users can purchase credits or subscriptions to access the software's features. The pricing varies based on the number of checks required and the level of service required. Overall, Plagium can be a valuable tool for individuals and organizations looking to ensure that their content is original and free from instances of plagiarism.
